# Notes on the reviews from PloS One

## Email for the journal
Dear Plos One Editors and Reviewers,

Thank you very much for considering the article.
We perceive that the article was not understood.
Mainly, we note that the model is very general
and not restricted to economical systems.
We believe that PloS One has a general audience
which is suitable for what we are presenting.
For these reasons,
we would like to ask for further consideration
of the article.
We are available to make it more palatable
while maintaining that it should be kept as
simple as possible.
Bellow are notes about each reviewer's comments.

Yours sincerely,
Renato Fabbri and Osvaldo N. Oliveira Jr.

## Reviewer #1
The title of the paper is A simple model that explains why inequality is ubiquitous and it is emphasized that the main topic is inequality in the wealth distribution. Indeed, there is a large literature in statistical physics about this topic. However, the authors do not cite a single paper about that, and the general impression is that they do not known this literature. There is no discussion between their results and other research. Also, the paper is permeated by affirmations without basis, for example ""Both deviations of power laws towards a more equitable or towards a more unequitable distribution should be ephemeral or require work." This affirmation is not in accord with results from Econophysics, where the Pareto exponent alpha can change to mor equitable values by natural changes of the models. More problematic is the tentative of subsume statistical power laws and geometrical or simple physics power laws within the same formalism. Geometrical and physical power laws like density = M/L^3, f = v/lambda (or v = lambda/T) are simple definitions. The exponent alpha = 2 in Newton gravity law (and Coulomb's law) occur because the particles that mediate such forces are massless (for another forces mediated by massive particles, the law is exponential, not power law). That is, all these power laws are or definitions or well understood phenomena that do not require explanation. And certainly, power laws such Zipf law for words and econophysics power laws have a limited range of validity. For example, econophysics data show that the Pareto power law is valid only for the 3% richer, the middle class and the poor are best described by a Boltzmann distribution. The fact that the authors are not aware about this shows that the paper disregarded the previous literature. As it is, I can not recommend the publication of the paper.

### Notes
Maybe emphasize that we are not concerned with human wealth inequality only, but that it is one important aspect.
Don't know about the massless mediation of gravity and Coulomb's law. Maybe state that we are giving a more general and simple explanation.
Maybe add about these aspects and the Boltzmann distribution on the paper.
Add a discussion between our results and other research.
Procurar sobre leis regidas por exponencial e relacionar.
De qualquer forma, não é qualquer fenômeno ou forma de observação numérica
que gera power law e várias outras distribuições são observadas.
Talvez incluir discussão com isso no artigo.

## Reviewer #2
Review of “A simple model that explains why inequality is ubiquitous”, by Renato Fabbri and Osvaldo Oliveira Jr.

The problems with this article starts when trying to read the abstract: the authors state that the model is based in two assumptions, but in the description one verifies that they actually include two second assumptions: “The second assumption is a uniform distribution of resources for individual components” and a few lines below, “The second assumption is a conservation law: energy is conserved through component wealth.” Why energy in an economic model? What is component wealth? Following this, one finds phrases like this one: “Applying these assumptions to a generic system results in a power-law distribution, whose coefficient is the number of inputs that are independent from each other, i.e. the dimensionality of the allocated resources.”

It is not so easy to obtain a power law from these assumptions, it is not clear what is the model that follow these assumptions and it is not clear what is the “coefficient of the power law”, is it the exponent?

The authors should also check a big number of publications in the subject of wealth distribution and inequalities that they ignore in the references, like the articles by Bouchaud and Mezard, Dragulescu and Yakovenko, the papers and book by Slanina, papers by Chaterjee, Chakraborti, Sinha, from India, Moukarzel from México, Pianegonda, Iglesias from Brazil, etc. For a more detailed list of references, even incomplete, the authors can check this review: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12328-8_4

Finally, it is not clear for me if there is a model in the article. If there is one, it should be clearly described, including interactions between agents.

For all these reasons, I think the article does not deserve publication.

### Notes
There are only two assumptions, the second statement is about the second assumption.
We are not considering only economic systems, the model is proposed to be as general as possible.
Component wealth is the amount of resources allocated to the component.
We replaced "coefficient" with "exponent" in the article.
We might further check and then cite the resources pointed by the reviewer.
The model is clearly stated in section 1.

Add section with "interactions between agents".
Add a "clear description of the model" in one or two sentences.

Fazer figura com distribuição equanime de recursos
e embaixo a exponencial resultante.
Implementar a tranformação de amostras de uma distribuição
uniforme para a lei de potência e explicitar as equações.

## Reviewer #3
I don't feel the paper at all manage to being to answer the question raised in the title. The pap er doesn't contain any model but only a number of unclear and badly presented or argued propositions. Of course the question why inequality appears is a very serious one and a simple model would be interesting. I agree with the wikipedia of a mathematical model:
"Mathematical models can take many forms, including dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models. These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. In general, mathematical models may include logical models. In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments. Lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed."
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) The paper doesn't contain anyhting like this.

Here are a number of commnets that express my bewilderment and concern.
Line 19 - Wha about SOC. I know the paper mention Ref. 2 but that isn't really enough to justify the statement that no unified framework is found in the literature.

line 22 - "|We demonstrate that the extreme inequality of power laws results from a uniform distribution with respect to the resources allocated to each component." The value of this kind of "demonstration" is very questionable. No concrete examples pointing to mechanisms is given. The results essentially a consequence of some verbale circular arguments

line 30. This quote is from Aristotle. It is of course OK to reference Aristotle, but then include a ref. and it doesn't make Def. 1 particularly new. And of course it is unclear what exactly is meant by "more than" - in what sense. This is the problem of "emergence" central to the theory of complex systems and not just a simple fact one can take for given.

line 39 What are "wave cycles"??

line 55 I think you want to explain diversity (in the form of inequality) so it is not a good idea to state that it is simply a deep truth.

line 59. Obviously not the case in general. But perhaps an interesting assumption in order to highlight inequality generating mechanisms.

line 74. But if the resources are oil and coal, then need to use addition.

### Notes
Oil and coal are the same dimension on the model. Thats why they add, not multiply.
Add this in the article.

line 89. Sounds very strange. The more wealth, the more resources one can purchase.

line 217. I think you try to do too many thing at a too abstract level. How does this relate to, say, gravity and 1/r^2?

### Notes
Can we make the propositions better presented and argued?
Should we strive to make the exposition more in accordance to what Wikipedia describes as a mathematical model?
SOC is about dynamical systems. Our model is more general.
Maybe change "demonstrate" to "argue". Maybe present clearly that p(k)/k^\alpha = C is what we are considering to be the natural law.
Find where Aristotle said it and cite on the paper? Anyway, we are not using Aristotle, but the complex system theory.
Maybe give examples of what the "more than" is: like birds flying in a triangle where not triangle is given by any individual bird.
Changed wave cycles for wave periods.
In the case of oil and coal, the resources are considered of the same type.

## Outras potenciais melhoras
* Incluir uma discussão sobre trabalhos relacionados,
mesmo que bem breve como uma lista em que cada item
cita uma teoria.
* Inclusão de algumas referências a mais.
No mais, sinto falta de um pouco mais de consistência
na nossa exposição, como parece ser o caso dos revisores.
Talvez também associar a teoria com princípios físicos
bastante gerais, como de ação estacionária.
Não me parece difícil obter uma equação (a Lagrangiana)
que seria minimizada no caso desta maximização do âmbito de recursos/componente
na distribuição de recursos 
* Expor nitidamente que dy(x)/dx = C => y = Cx ~ y = C z^alpha
