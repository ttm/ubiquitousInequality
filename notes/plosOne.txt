The article presents an explanation for the pervasiveness of power laws.
This issue is strikingly relevant for many knowledge domains,
from social inequality and perception to biological and physical phenomena,
given the ubiquity of power laws in empirical data.
The model is posed in formal terms by means of propositions and corollaries.
Paradigmatic incidences of the power laws are analyzed in terms of the model
and the consequent inequality is observed both from desirable and non-desirable perspectives.
We strived to keep all very simple, which we believe makes the contributions far compelling.

The choice of Plos One for the publication of the article
is based on the broad interest of the audience
and on the online and free access.
